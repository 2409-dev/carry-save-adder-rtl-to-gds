# carry-save-adder-rtl-to-gds
project implements a 16-bit Carry Save Adder (CSA) using a semi-custom VLSI design flow. The design was modeled at the RTL level using Verilog, synthesized using Cadence Genus, and implemented physically using Cadence Innovus. The final layout was verified through DRC and GDSII generation.
